# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Building and HTML page that will allow for data to be pulled from a javascript data file with filtering capability.  The filters can be used to review different sightings based on dates, US cities and states, as well as by shape of the "object" seen.  This give the users the ability to filter using different criteria.

## Results
Upon entering the website, the clients will be welcomed by the known message "The Truth Is Out There" along with a few paragraphs based on the age old question, are UFOs real or fantasy?

As the users continue to scroll down the page they will find information related to differen sightings data that has been collected.    To the left to the website, they will find five options of which to filter by.    They have the ability to search by date, city, state, country, and/or shape.   More than one search option can be used at a time.   This helps narrow down the specific selections for the user.

## Summary
The website created is clean and allows users to filter through the different available sightings information.  Once drawback noticed is that the data could use more details.   Once suggestions I would recommend adding is time of sightings.  This would help to see if the time of day the sightings occurred was more of an occurence during day or night.  Second recommendation would be to include how many individuals witnessed the sightings.   This would give it more authenticity to know more than one person reported the sighting.   Another item that would not hurt is to somehow have the page updated with new sightings as they are reported.
